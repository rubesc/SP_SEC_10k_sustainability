            <h2> Abstract </h2>

            <p>
                This capstone project investigates how climate sentiment is portrayed in corporate financial reporting,
                focusing on SEC 10-K filings from leading S&P 50 companies. These filings offer detailed insights into
                financial performance, risks, and management discussions, providing a rich dataset for analyzing
                corporate behaviors with sustainability and environmental concerns.

                Through meticulous examination of these legally binding financial disclosures, this study sheds light on
                the extent to which companies address environmental issues and the implications for environmental
                stewardship. Drawing inspiration
                from established greenwashing indicator frameworks, the study develops a climate sentiment framework
                tailored to the context of SEC 10-K filings.

                By contributing to the broader discourse on environmental challenges, stewardship, and corporate
                transparency, this research offers valuable insights for
                academia, industry stakeholders, and policymakers grappling with environmental issues in the corporate
                sector. It provides a nuanced understanding of corporate practices and highlights avenues for improving
                environmental reporting and accountability.

            <h2> Context </h2>

            <p> As concerns regarding corporate sustainability and environmental responsibility continue to mount, the
                phenomenon of greenwashing emerges as an area of critical scrutiny. While numerous Greenwashing
                Indicator (GWI) frameworks have been devised to measure and identify greenwashing practices, they
                predominantly target sustainability reports and green-labeled products. However, the intersection of
                greenwashing indicators with financial communications, such as SEC Filings Form 10-K, remains relatively
                underexplored.
            </p>
            <p>
                This research aims to bridge this gap by examining how sustainability is manifested in financial
                reporting, particularly within SEC Filings Form 10-K. This focus is pivotal because these SEC filings
                hold legal weight and undergo thorough examination. This approach offers a unique perspective on
                corporations' climate action positions. In our market-driven capitalist environment, publicly traded
                companies often prioritize profits over environmental concerns, guided by shareholder interests. This
                study intends to illuminate the extent to which climate action is integrated into a company's core
                operations, strategy, and risk management. Given the legally binding nature of 10-K filings, they serve
                as an ideal arena for such exploration.

            <h2> Detailed summary </h2>


            <h3> Quick introduction to SEC 10-K filing </h3>
            <p>SEC 10-K filings are comprehensive annual reports submitted by publicly traded companies to the U.S.
                Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings provide detailed insights into a company's
                financial performance, risks, and management discussions, making them crucial sources of information for
                investors, analysts, and researchers. In the context of this research, SEC 10-K filings serve as primary
                data sources for analyzing how companies address climate-related issues in their business operations and
                risk management strategies.</p>

            <p>For the purpose of this analysis, we will focus on the first two parts of the 10-K (highlighted in the
                yellow box):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Section 1 (Business):</strong> This section provides crucial insights into a company's
                    business operations, including their products or services, market position, and competitive
                    landscape. It serves as a foundational component for understanding how companies approach
                    climate-related issues within their business strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Section 1A (Risk):</strong> In this section, companies outline various risks that may affect
                    their operations, including environmental risks such as climate change. Analyzing this section is
                    essential for evaluating how companies perceive and address climate-related risks in their SEC 10-K
                    filings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3> A framework with five types of climate sentiments in SEC 10-K Filings </h3>

            <br>
            <p> A framework comprising five types of climate sentiments identified within SEC 10-K filings was developed
                by referring to key indicators of greenwashing and exemplars of best practices in corporate reporting.
                Special attention was given to applying these concepts specifically to the business and risk sections of
                the 10-K filings, ensuring relevance and practicality. This framework draws inspiration from the
                Greenwashing Assessment Tool outlined in the Issue Brief titled "Why addressing greenwashing remains as
                important as ever (and what can be done about it)" by Wren Montgomery, Tom Lyon, Julian Barg, and
                Matthew Lynch, published by the Ivey Centre for Building Sustainable Value & Erb Institute.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p> The framework is structured as follows: </p>

            <h3> Distirbution of climate sentiments in SEC 10-K Fillings of S&P 50 companies</h3>


            <p> The breakdown of climate sentiments across SEC 10-K filings of S&P 50 companies illustrates distinct
                tiers of engagement with climate issues, with each company categorized accordingly based on their
                disclosed attitudes and actions towards climate-related matters. </p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Unfortunately, the majority of companies within this cohort are classified into the "victimized" group,
                suggesting a prevalent pattern of acknowledging climate risks as a business risk in their SEC 10-K
                filings. However, they do not mention any climate actions in the "business" section of their filings.
                It's important to note that this analysis solely focuses on sections 1 and 1A of the 10-K filings and
                does not consider alternative or external materials that companies may provide.

            <h4> Sentiment Level #1: Invisible </h4>
            <h5> Overview: A complete lack of acknowledgment </h5>
            <p> <b>Details: </b></p>
            <p> At the "invisible" level, these companies demonstrate a complete lack of acknowledgment of
                climate-related issues, with no mention of climate change or climate action found in either Section 1A
                (Risk) or Section 1 (Business) of their 10-K filings.

                This signifies a concerning absence of awareness or recognition of the importance of climate-related
                considerations within their operations and strategies, suggesting that
                even if they incorporate such considerations in their business operations, they may not perceive them as
                significant enough to disclose to investors in their 10K filings.

            <p> <b>Details: </b></p>
            <p> At the "Victimized" level, companies acknowledge climate risk but exhibit a lack of action or
                substantive engagement with climate-related issues demonstrated in their 10K filings.
                While they mention climate change as a business risk in Section 1A, they do not emphasize climate action
                within their business operations and strategies outlined in Section 1. Note that this doesn't
                neccesarily imply that the company lacks climate action or relevant initiatives. Rather,
                it suggests that even if they do have such initiatives, the company doesn't consider them significant
                enough to highlight in their 10K filings.

            <h4> Sentiment Level #3: Tokenistic </h4>
            <h5> Overview: Demonstration of surface-level climate action engagement. </h5>
            <p> <b>Details: </b></p>
            <p> At the "Tokenistic" level, companies demonstrate surface-level engagement with climate
                action. While they acknowledge climate change as a business risk in Section 1A and mention climate
                action within their business operations in Section 1, these mentions lack relevant and actionable
                details. This suggests that while these companies recognize the importance of climate-related
                considerations, their efforts may be superficial or insufficient to drive meaningful change.
                Similarly, it doesn't necessarily imply that the company lacks climate action or relevant initiatives.
                Instead, it indicates that even if they do have such initiatives, the company may not consider them
                significant enough to highlight in their 10K filings.

            <h5> Overview: Demonstration of some engaged climate responsibility. </h5>
            <p> <b>Details: </b></p>
            <p> At the "Developing Commitment" level, companies demonstrate a degree of engagement with climate
                responsibility. They acknowledge climate change as a business risk in Section 1A and include mentions of
                climate action in their business operations in Section 1. Unlike the "Tokenistic" level, these companies
                exhibit more substantial consideration in their mentions. However, they may lack pertinent details, such
                as identifying their top CO2 emission contributors, or clear commitments to climate goals. This suggests
                they are still playing it safe while signaling their considerations.

            <p> <b>Details: </b></p>
            <p> At the "Proactive Stewardship" level, companies demonstrate a firm investment in climate action as an
                integral part of their business strategy. They acknowledge climate change as a business risk in Section
                1A and extensively discuss climate action in their business operations in Section 1. Most importantly,
                these companies provide relevant and in-depth details, such as how their supply chain contributes to the
                greenhouse effect, and include clear climate goals with transparent metrics. This demonstrates a strong
                commitment to addressing climate-related issues.

            <h2> Conclusions </h2>

            <p> This research has provided a view into of how leading S&P 50 companies address climate-related
                issues within their SEC 10-K filings. A climate sentiment framework has been created, categorizing
                companies into five distinct levels based on both their acknowledgment of climate change as a business
                risk and their commitment to climate action within these filings.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                There are several avenues for further exploration and refinement of findings from this
                project. One potential direction is the application of advanced text analysis and machine learning
                techniques to scale the assessment to a broader set of companies beyond the S&P 50. By leveraging these
                tools, we may enhance the efficiency and accuracy of our analysis, enabling us to gain insights into
                climate sentiment
                across a more extensive range of corporations. Furthermore, exploring beyond the two sections
                highlighted in our study—Sections 1 (Business) and 1A
                (Risk)—to include other sections of the SEC 10-K filings could provide a more comprehensive
                understanding of how companies integrate climate-related considerations into their overall disclosure
                practices.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In addition, a comparative analysis of information consistency between companies' sustainability reports
                and their financial disclosures could also offer valuable insights into the alignment—or lack
                thereof—between stated commitments and actual practices. By examining discrepancies and inconsistencies
                between these
                documents, we can gain a deeper understanding of companies' transparency and accountability regarding
                their climate-related efforts. This could inform efforts to enhance reporting standards and promote
                greater transparency in corporate sustainability disclosures.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                While policy and regulatory interventions play a crucial role in setting the stage for
                climate action, as demonstrated by the acknowledgment of climate as a business risk in the majority of
                this cohort of companies' SEC 10-K filings, the profit-driven nature of the current market dynamic means
                that
                investor pressure and market incentives can also be powerful drivers of change. By incorporating climate
                considerations into investment decision-making processes and applying pressure on companies to
                prioritize climate action alongside profit, investors can catalyze meaningful change.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In conclusion, this research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on corporate climate sentiment
                and underscores the importance of integrating climate considerations into corporate strategies and
                financial disclosures. By developing a nuanced understanding of how leading corporations address
                climate-related issues in their SEC 10K filings, we can identify opportunities for improvement and
                advocate for greater
                transparency, accountability, and action on climate change. As we continue to refine our methodologies
                and expand our analysis, we aim to empower stakeholders with the insights they need to drive meaningful
                progress towards a more sustainable and resilient future.

            <h5> <u> Limitations of this study </u> </h5>
            <ul class="limitations-list">
                <li>The study acknowledges that the latest SEC 10-K filings utilized in the dataset preparation span
                    across different fiscal years, ranging from 2022 to 2023. This variation may not fully capture the
                    most current sentiment of companies on climate action, potentially overlooking those that have made
                    significant improvements in their stance during the intervening period.</li>

                <li>The analysis methodology employed a combination of manual review and NLP techniques, which
                    introduces the possibility of bias, subjective interpretation, or human error. While efforts were
                    made to mitigate these issues, they remain inherent limitations of the study.</li>

                <li>It is important to note that some companies may have robust climate or ESG programs that are not
                    adequately represented in their 10-K filings. As a result, the study is confined to analyzing how
                    companies articulate their climate-related efforts in these filings, which may differ from their
                    broader sustainability reports or other communication materials.</li>

                <li>Due to resource constraints, the study focused solely on Sections 1 (Business) and 1A (Risk) of the
                    SEC 10-K filings. Consequently, valuable insights from other sections of the filings, such as
                    Management's Discussion and Analysis or Legal Proceedings, were not included in the analysis,
                    potentially limiting the comprehensiveness of the findings.</li>

                <li>The dataset used for analysis was derived from publicly available sources, which may not encompass
                    all relevant companies or capture nuanced aspects of their climate-related disclosures.
                    Additionally, the study's reliance on SEC filings may overlook alternative channels through which
                    companies communicate their climate strategies, such as corporate websites or sustainability
                    reports.</li>
            </ul>
