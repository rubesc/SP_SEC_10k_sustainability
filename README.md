# SP_SEC_10k_sustainability


## Overview
As concerns regarding corporate sustainability and environmental responsibility grow, the phenomenon of greenwashing becomes a critical area of scrutiny. While many Greenwashing Indicator (GWI) frameworks have been developed to measure and identify greenwashing practices, they are often focusing on sustainability reports. The intersection of greenwashing indicators with financial communications (e.g. SEC Filings Form 10-K) remains an underexplored area. The objective of this research is to investigate how sustainability is reflected in their financial reporting and to uncover any discrepancies or inconsistencies that may indicate the presence of greenwashing strategies within corporate communications.

## Abstract

This capstone project investigates how climate sentiment is portrayed in corporate financial reporting,
focusing on SEC 10-K filings from leading S&P 50 companies. These filings offer detailed insights into
financial performance, risks, and management discussions, providing a rich dataset for analyzing
corporate behaviors with sustainability and environmental concerns. Through meticulous examination of
these legally binding financial disclosures, this study sheds light on the extent to which companies
address environmental issues and the implications for environmental stewardship. Drawing inspiration
from established greenwashing indicator frameworks, the study develops a climate sentiment framework
tailored to the context of SEC 10-K filings. By contributing to the broader discourse on environmental
challenges, stewardship, and corporate transparency, this research offers valuable insights for
academia, industry stakeholders, and policymakers grappling with environmental issues in the corporate
sector. It provides a nuanced understanding of corporate practices and highlights avenues for improving
environmental reporting and accountability.
