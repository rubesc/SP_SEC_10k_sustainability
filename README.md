# SP_SEC_10k_sustainability


## Overview
As concerns regarding corporate sustainability and environmental responsibility grow, the phenomenon of greenwashing becomes a critical area of scrutiny. While many Greenwashing Indicator (GWI) frameworks have been developed to measure and identify greenwashing practices, they are often focusing on sustainability reports. The intersection of greenwashing indicators with financial communications (e.g. SEC Filings Form 10-K) remains an underexplored area. The objective of this research is to investigate how sustainability is reflected in their financial reporting and to uncover any discrepancies or inconsistencies that may indicate the presence of greenwashing strategies within corporate communications.

## Abstract

This capstone project focuses on analyzing SEC Filings Form 10-K of S&P companies to investigate how sustainability shows up in their financial reportings. The study aims to distinguish these authentic representations from potential greenwashing narratives and lies often found in optional CRS reports and marketing materials. Informed by existing studies on greenwashing indicators, the research establishes a framework applied to assess environmental claims and narratives of leading public companies. The study aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in enhancing the effectiveness of greenwashing detection methodologies.
